# Rust data

Dummy project to try Rust at tasks I would normally do in python: 🦀 >> 🐍 ??

Same excercise than [C++ data processing](https://github.com/tirelt/cpp_data_processing) which was a disaster.


## Notebook

1. Create a python `venv` with jupyter notebook (same as usual)
```Bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
